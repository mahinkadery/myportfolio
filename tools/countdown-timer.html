        <h2>Countdown Timer – Boost Productivity & Stay Focused</h2>
        
        <!-- 3. Introduction -->
        <p class="lead">
          Time management is the foundation of productivity. Whether you're working on a deadline, cooking dinner, or taking a timed break, having a reliable countdown timer helps you stay on track and avoid the constant phone-checking distraction. The <strong>Countdown Timer</strong> by ToolfolioHub is a simple, web-based timer that runs directly in your browser—no app downloads, no complex features, just a clean timer that does exactly what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike smartphone timer apps that get buried in your home screen or require unlocking your device, this timer lives in your browser tab. It's perfect for focus sessions, Pomodoro technique, cooking, workouts, meditation, or any activity where you need to track time without distractions.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. What is -->
        <h2>What is a Countdown Timer?</h2>
        <p>
          A countdown timer is a tool that counts down from a set duration (e.g., 25 minutes, 5 minutes) to zero. It displays the remaining time in real-time and typically alerts you when the time expires. Unlike a stopwatch (which counts up), a countdown timer helps you work toward a specific time goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our countdown timer allows you to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set any duration in minutes and seconds.</li>
          <li>Start the countdown with a single click.</li>
          <li>Pause the timer if you need to take a break.</li>
          <li>Reset to start over or set a new duration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This simplicity makes it ideal for various time-management techniques and daily tasks.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. Features -->
        <h2>Key Features & Benefits</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Simple, Intuitive Controls</h3>
        <p>
          The timer interface is designed for ease of use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input Fields:</strong> Enter minutes and seconds separately for precise control.</li>
          <li><strong>Start Button:</strong> Begin the countdown instantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Pause Button:</strong> Temporarily stop the timer without resetting.</li>
          <li><strong>Reset Button:</strong> Clear the timer and start fresh.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No complex settings, no learning curve—just set and go.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Large, Clear Display</h3>
        <p>
          The countdown display shows the remaining time in MM:SS format (e.g., "25:00", "04:32"). The large, bold numbers are easy to read at a glance, even from across the room. This is especially valuable during workouts or when your hands are busy cooking.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Browser-Based Convenience</h3>
        <p>
          Running in your browser means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No App Installation:</strong> Works immediately without downloading anything.</li>
          <li><strong>Works on Any Device:</strong> Desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone—anything with a browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Tab-Friendly:</strong> Keep it open in a browser tab while you work, switching back to check the time.</li>
          <li><strong>No Background Permissions:</strong> Unlike phone apps, it doesn't need special permissions to run.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Precise Second-by-Second Countdown</h3>
        <p>
          The timer updates every second, giving you exact real-time feedback. When it reaches zero, the countdown stops, clearly indicating that your time is up.
        </p>

        <!-- 6. How to Use -->
        <h2>How to Use the Countdown Timer</h2>
        <p>
          Using the timer is straightforward:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Set the Duration:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Enter the number of minutes in the "Minutes" field (e.g., `25`).</li>
              <li>Enter the number of seconds in the "Seconds" field (e.g., `0`).</li>
              <li>You can set just minutes (leave seconds at 0) or combine both (e.g., 5 minutes 30 seconds = enter `5` minutes and `30` seconds).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Start the Timer:</strong> Click the "Start" button. The countdown begins immediately, displaying the remaining time.</li>
          <li><strong>Pause (Optional):</strong> If you need to pause, click "Pause." The timer stops but remembers where you left off. Click "Start" again to resume.</li>
          <li><strong>Reset (Optional):</strong> Click "Reset" to stop the timer and clear it back to 00:00. You can then set a new duration.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          <br>You want to time a 25-minute focus session:
          <br>1. Enter `25` in Minutes, `0` in Seconds.
          <br>2. Click Start.
          <br>3. The timer counts down from 25:00 to 00:00.
          <br>4. When it reaches 00:00, your session is complete.
        </p>

        <!-- 7. Use Cases -->
        <h2>Typical Use-Cases & Audience</h2>

        <h3>Pomodoro Technique & Focus Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method that uses 25-minute focused work intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. Our timer is perfect for this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Work Session:</strong> Set 25 minutes, focus on one task, start the timer.</li>
          <li><strong>Break Time:</strong> After the timer ends, take a 5-minute break.</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> After 4 work sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This technique helps maintain focus, prevents burnout, and increases productivity by breaking work into manageable chunks.
        </p>

        <h3>Cooking & Kitchen Use</h3>
        <p>
          Timers are essential in the kitchen:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boiling Eggs:</strong> 6-7 minutes for soft-boiled, 10-12 minutes for hard-boiled.</li>
          <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Set timer for exact baking times (e.g., 18 minutes for cookies).</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Dishes:</strong> Use multiple browser tabs for different dishes cooking simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Marinating:</strong> Time how long food has been marinating.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unlike phone timers that can get buried under other apps, a browser tab timer stays visible and accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>Exercise & Workouts</h3>
        <p>
          Interval training and circuit workouts rely heavily on timers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HIIT Workouts:</strong> 30 seconds work, 10 seconds rest intervals.</li>
          <li><strong>Circuit Training:</strong> 45 seconds per exercise, 15 seconds transition.</li>
          <li><strong>Rest Periods:</strong> Time your rest between sets (e.g., 90 seconds).</li>
          <li><strong>Plank Challenges:</strong> Time your planks and work toward longer durations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The large display is easy to see while exercising, even from a distance.
        </p>

        <h3>Meditation & Mindfulness</h3>
        <p>
          Many meditation practices use timers to maintain structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daily Meditation:</strong> Start with 5 minutes, gradually increase to 10, 15, or 20 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Breathing Exercises:</strong> Time breathing patterns (e.g., 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out).</li>
          <li><strong>Mindful Breaks:</strong> Take 3-5 minute mindful breaks during the day.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Study Sessions & Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Students use timers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Focused Study Blocks:</strong> 45-minute study sessions with 15-minute breaks.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Tests:</strong> Simulate exam conditions with timed practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading Time:</strong> Allocate specific time blocks for reading assignments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Work Breaks & Productivity</h3>
        <p>
          Take structured breaks to maintain productivity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Micro-Breaks:</strong> 2-3 minute breaks every hour to stretch and rest your eyes.</li>
          <li><strong>Lunch Breaks:</strong> Ensure you take your full lunch break (e.g., 30 minutes).</li>
          <li><strong>Task Switching:</strong> Time-box specific tasks to avoid spending too long on any one thing.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 9. FAQs -->
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        
        <h3>Does the timer make a sound when it finishes?</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, our timer stops at 00:00 and doesn't play an audio alert. This keeps the tool simple and prevents unexpected sounds. For audible alerts, you may want to use your device's built-in timer or a dedicated timer app with sound features.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Workaround:</strong> If you need an alert, you can set a second timer on your phone or use your computer's system notification settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I run multiple timers at once?</h3>
        <p>
          You can open multiple browser tabs, each with its own timer. This is useful when cooking multiple dishes or timing different activities simultaneously. Simply:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the timer page in a new tab.</li>
          <li>Set a different duration in that tab.</li>
          <li>Start both timers independently.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Will the timer continue if I switch browser tabs?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, the timer continues counting down even if you switch to another browser tab or minimize the window. However, be aware that some browsers may throttle JavaScript timers when tabs are in the background to save resources. For critical timing, keep the timer tab visible.
        </p>

        <h3>What's the maximum duration I can set?</h3>
        <p>
          You can set any duration using minutes and seconds. There's no technical maximum, but practical limits would be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minutes: Any reasonable number (e.g., 60 minutes for an hour, 120 for two hours).</li>
          <li>Seconds: 0-59 (standard format).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For very long durations (several hours), you might want to use hours:minutes:seconds format mentally or convert to minutes (e.g., 2 hours = 120 minutes).
        </p>

        <h3>Does the timer work offline?</h3>
        <p>
          Once the page loads, the timer runs entirely in your browser using JavaScript. As long as you don't refresh the page or close the tab, it works offline. However, you need an internet connection to initially load the page.
        </p>

        <!-- 10. Tips -->
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bookmark for Quick Access:</strong> Save this timer page to your bookmarks bar for instant access. This is faster than opening an app.</li>
          <li><strong>Use for Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Combine with the Pomodoro method: 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break, repeat 4 times, then a longer break.</li>
          <li><strong>Tab Management:</strong> Keep the timer in a separate browser tab that you can quickly switch to. Consider pinning the tab so it doesn't get closed accidentally.</li>
          <li><strong>Combine with Task Lists:</strong> Use the timer to time-box tasks from your to-do list. This prevents spending too long on any single task.</li>
        </ul>
