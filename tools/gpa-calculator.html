        <h2>GPA Calculator – Calculate Your Grade Point Average Accurately</h2>
        
        <!-- 3. Introduction -->
        <p class="lead">
          Your Grade Point Average (GPA) is one of the most important numbers in your academic career. It determines scholarship eligibility, graduate school admissions, honor roll status, and even some job opportunities. But calculating GPA manually—especially when courses have different credit hours—is tedious and error-prone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>GPA Calculator</strong> by ToolfolioHub simplifies this process entirely. Whether you're tracking your semester GPA, calculating your cumulative GPA across multiple terms, or planning what grades you need to achieve a target GPA, this tool provides accurate, weighted calculations instantly.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. What is -->
        <h2>What is GPA?</h2>
        <p>
          GPA (Grade Point Average) is a numerical representation of your academic performance, calculated by averaging your grades across all courses. In most systems, each letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) corresponds to a grade point value, typically on a 4.0 scale:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A:</strong> 4.0 points</li>
          <li><strong>B:</strong> 3.0 points</li>
          <li><strong>C:</strong> 2.0 points</li>
          <li><strong>D:</strong> 1.0 points</li>
          <li><strong>F:</strong> 0.0 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, GPA isn't simply the average of grade points. It's a <strong>weighted average</strong> that accounts for credit hours. A 3-credit course affects your GPA more than a 1-credit course, even if you got the same grade in both.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The formula:</strong> GPA = (Sum of (Credit Hours × Grade Points)) ÷ Total Credit Hours
        </p>
        <p>
          This weighted calculation ensures that courses with more credit hours have a proportionally larger impact on your overall GPA.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. Features -->
        <h2>Key Features & Benefits</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Weighted GPA Calculation</h3>
        <p>
          Our calculator correctly implements weighted GPA, where each course's contribution is proportional to its credit hours:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A 4-credit course with an A (4.0) contributes 16 points (4 credits × 4.0).</li>
          <li>A 2-credit course with an A (4.0) contributes 8 points (2 credits × 4.0).</li>
          <li>The final GPA accounts for these differences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This ensures accuracy that simple averaging can't provide.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Dynamic Subject Management</h3>
        <p>
          Add or remove subjects as needed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Add Multiple Courses:</strong> Click "+ Add subject" to add as many courses as you need.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove Courses:</strong> Click the "×" button on any row to remove that course.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible Input:</strong> Enter course names (optional, for organization), credit hours, and grade points.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This flexibility makes it perfect for calculating semester GPAs, cumulative GPAs, or "what-if" scenarios.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Precise Decimal Calculation</h3>
        <p>
          GPA is typically displayed to 2 decimal places (e.g., 3.75). Our calculator:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Performs calculations with full precision internally.</li>
          <li>Displays results rounded to 2 decimal places (standard format).</li>
          <li>Shows total credit hours for verification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Support for 4.0 Scale</h3>
        <p>
          Our calculator uses the standard 4.0 scale, which is the most common in North American universities. Grade points typically range from 0.0 to 4.0, with increments possible for +/- grades:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A+ = 4.0, A = 4.0, A- = 3.7</li>
          <li>B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7</li>
          <li>C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0, C- = 1.7</li>
          <li>D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, D- = 0.7</li>
          <li>F = 0.0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can enter any grade point value (including decimals) to match your school's specific grading system.
        </p>

        <!-- 9. FAQs -->
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        
        <h3>What's the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Unweighted GPA:</strong> Simple average of grade points, treating all courses equally. If you get a B (3.0) in a 1-credit course and a B in a 4-credit course, both contribute equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Weighted GPA (what we calculate):</strong> Accounts for credit hours. The 4-credit course contributes 4× more to your GPA than the 1-credit course. This is the standard method used by most universities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> If you get a B (3.0) in a 4-credit course and an A (4.0) in a 1-credit course:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unweighted average = (3.0 + 4.0) ÷ 2 = 3.5</li>
          <li>Weighted GPA = ((4×3.0) + (1×4.0)) ÷ 5 = 16 ÷ 5 = 3.2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The weighted GPA is lower because the B in the larger course has more impact. This is more accurate.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I convert letter grades to grade points?</h3>
        <p>
          Most schools use a standard 4.0 scale conversion:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A+ or A = 4.0</li>
          <li>A- = 3.7</li>
          <li>B+ = 3.3</li>
          <li>B = 3.0</li>
          <li>B- = 2.7</li>
          <li>C+ = 2.3</li>
          <li>C = 2.0</li>
          <li>C- = 1.7</li>
          <li>D+ = 1.3</li>
          <li>D = 1.0</li>
          <li>D- = 0.7</li>
          <li>F = 0.0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Some schools may use slightly different scales. Check your school's official grading policy to confirm the exact grade point values.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use this for cumulative GPA across multiple semesters?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Yes!</strong> Simply add all courses from all semesters:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add all courses from Semester 1.</li>
          <li>Click "+ Add subject" and add all courses from Semester 2.</li>
          <li>Continue for all semesters.</li>
          <li>Click "Calculate GPA" to get your cumulative GPA.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The calculator will automatically weight everything correctly, giving you an accurate cumulative GPA.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my school uses a different scale (e.g., 5.0 for honors/AP courses)?</h3>
        <p>
          Our calculator uses a standard 4.0 scale. If your school uses weighted grades for honors/AP courses (where an A might be worth 5.0 instead of 4.0), you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter the weighted grade point directly (e.g., enter 5.0 for an A in an AP course).</li>
          <li>The calculator will treat it as entered and calculate accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, be aware that different schools may have different policies for how weighted courses factor into overall GPA. Consult your school's registrar or academic advisor for official GPA calculation methods.
        </p>

        <h3>How accurate is the calculator?</h3>
        <p>
          Our calculator uses the standard weighted GPA formula used by universities worldwide:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>GPA = Σ(Credit Hours × Grade Points) ÷ Σ(Credit Hours)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Results match official university GPA calculations when using the same input data. However, always verify with your school's official transcript for the most accurate GPA, as schools may have specific policies (e.g., rounding methods, pass/fail courses, etc.).
        </p>

        <!-- 10. Tips -->
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Double-Check Your Inputs:</strong> Verify credit hours and grade points match your official transcript before calculating. Small errors can affect your GPA significantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Use for Planning:</strong> Before registering for courses, use the calculator to estimate how different grade scenarios will affect your GPA. This helps with strategic course selection.</li>
          <li><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Calculate your GPA at the end of each semester to track improvement over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Understand Credit Hours:</strong> Most courses are 3-4 credits. Labs are often 1 credit. Make sure you're using the correct credit hours from your course catalog.</li>
        </ul>
