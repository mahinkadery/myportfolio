        <h2>Password Generator – Create Strong, Secure Passwords Instantly</h2>
        
        <!-- 3. Introduction -->
        <p class="lead">
          Weak passwords are one of the biggest security vulnerabilities online. Reusing the same password across multiple sites, using easily guessable passwords like "password123," or incorporating personal information makes your accounts vulnerable to hackers. Yet creating strong, unique passwords for every account is challenging—especially when you need dozens of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Password Generator</strong> by ToolfolioHub solves this problem by creating cryptographically random passwords instantly. With customizable length and character sets, you can generate passwords that meet any security requirement—from basic website logins to high-security applications. Best of all, it runs entirely in your browser, ensuring your passwords never leave your device.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. What is -->
        <h2>What is a Password Generator?</h2>
        <p>
          A password generator is a tool that automatically creates random passwords using a mathematical algorithm. Unlike human-generated passwords (which often follow patterns or include personal information), computer-generated passwords are truly random, making them much harder to guess or crack through brute-force attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our password generator:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses JavaScript's built-in random number generator to select characters.</li>
          <li>Pools characters from selected character sets (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols).</li>
          <li>Assembles these characters into a password of your specified length.</li>
          <li>Ensures each character position is independently random.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The result is a password that is statistically unpredictable, even to sophisticated attackers using password-cracking software.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. Features -->
        <h2>Key Features & Benefits</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Customizable Length</h3>
        <p>
          Our generator allows you to set password length from 6 to 32 characters using a slider. This flexibility lets you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meet Site Requirements:</strong> Many sites have minimum length requirements (often 8-12 characters). Adjust the slider to meet these requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance Security vs. Usability:</strong> Longer passwords are more secure but harder to remember. Choose a length that fits your needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Recommended Length:</strong> Security experts recommend at least 12-16 characters for strong passwords. Our default is 16 characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Flexible Character Sets</h3>
        <p>
          Customize which characters your password includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lowercase Letters (a-z):</strong> 26 characters. Always recommended for basic security.</li>
          <li><strong>Uppercase Letters (A-Z):</strong> 26 characters. Adds complexity and meets most site requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Numbers (0-9):</strong> 10 characters. Commonly required by websites.</li>
          <li><strong>Symbols (!@#$%...):</strong> Special characters. Adds maximum complexity but may not be accepted by all sites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can select any combination of these sets. More character sets mean more possible combinations, increasing password strength exponentially.
        </p>

        <h3>3. One-Click Copy</h3>
        <p>
          Generated passwords can be copied to your clipboard instantly with a single click. This makes it easy to paste directly into password fields during account creation, without the risk of typos when manually entering a long password.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Client-Side Generation (Privacy)</h3>
        <p>
          All password generation happens locally in your browser using JavaScript. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Server Transmission:</strong> Your passwords are never sent over the internet.</li>
          <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We don't save or log any generated passwords.</li>
          <li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Even we can't see what passwords you generate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This privacy-first approach ensures your security tool doesn't become a security risk itself.
        </p>

        <!-- 6. How to Use -->
        <h2>How to Use the Password Generator</h2>
        <p>
          Generating a secure password takes just a few steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Set Password Length:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the slider to select your desired password length (6-32 characters).</li>
              <li>The current value is displayed next to "Length."</li>
              <li>For maximum security, use 16+ characters.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Select Character Sets:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Check the boxes for character sets you want to include:
                <ul>
                  <li>✓ Lowercase (recommended)</li>
                  <li>✓ Uppercase (recommended)</li>
                  <li>✓ Numbers (recommended)</li>
                  <li>Symbols (optional—may not work on all sites)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>At least one character set must be selected.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Generate Password:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Click "Generate Password" button.</li>
              <li>A random password appears in the output field.</li>
              <li>Click "Generate Password" again to create a different password.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Copy Password:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Click the "Copy" button to copy the password to your clipboard.</li>
              <li>Paste it directly into the password field when creating an account.</li>
              <li>Store it in a password manager for future use.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          <br>You're creating a new email account that requires a password with at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
          <br>1. Set length slider to 16.
          <br>2. Check: Lowercase ✓, Uppercase ✓, Numbers ✓ (leave Symbols unchecked).
          <br>3. Click "Generate Password."
          <br>4. Result: Something like "K7mP9qR2wX5vN8bJ"
          <br>5. Click "Copy" and paste into the account creation form.
        </p>

        <!-- 9. FAQs -->
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        
        <h3>How secure are the generated passwords?</h3>
        <p>
          Our passwords are generated using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function, which in modern browsers uses cryptographically secure algorithms. The passwords are statistically random, meaning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No patterns or predictable sequences.</li>
          <li>Each character is independently selected.</li>
          <li>Equal probability for all characters in the selected sets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A 16-character password using all character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) has approximately 6.2 × 10^30 possible combinations, making it virtually impossible to crack through brute force.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I memorize generated passwords?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>No!</strong> Strong, randomly generated passwords are designed to be stored in a password manager, not memorized. Trying to memorize random strings leads to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Password reuse (using the same password for multiple sites).</li>
          <li>Writing passwords down (which creates physical security risks).</li>
          <li>Simplifying passwords to make them memorable (defeating the purpose).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Generate a unique password for each account and store it in a reputable password manager (like LastPass, 1Password, or Bitwarden). Use the password manager's master password (which you do memorize) to access all your passwords.
        </p>

        <h3>What password length should I use?</h3>
        <p>
          Password strength depends on both length and character variety:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minimum (8-10 characters):</strong> Meets most site requirements but less secure. Use only if a site has strict length limits.</li>
          <li><strong>Recommended (12-16 characters):</strong> Strong security for most personal accounts. Our default is 16 characters.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum Security (20+ characters):</strong> For financial accounts, email, or other high-value targets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> Longer is always better. Each additional character multiplies the possible combinations exponentially.
        </p>

        <h3>Why can't I select symbols for some passwords?</h3>
        <p>
          Some websites don't accept certain special characters, or they have restrictions on which symbols are allowed. If a site rejects your password:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uncheck the "Symbols" option.</li>
          <li>Generate a new password using only letters and numbers.</li>
          <li>Consider increasing the length to compensate for the reduced character set.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Are the passwords stored or logged anywhere?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>No.</strong> The password generation happens entirely in your browser:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No data is sent to any server.</li>
          <li>No passwords are stored in cookies or local storage.</li>
          <li>No logs or records are kept.</li>
          <li>The password exists only in the browser's memory until you copy it or refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This ensures maximum privacy and security.
        </p>

        <!-- 10. Tips -->
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> Don't try to remember generated passwords. Use a reputable password manager to store them securely.</li>
          <li><strong>One Password Per Account:</strong> Never reuse passwords across multiple sites. If one site is breached, reused passwords compromise all your accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Strong passwords are important, but 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Use both together.</li>
          <li><strong>Check Site Requirements First:</strong> Before generating, check the site's password requirements (length, character types) to generate a compatible password on the first try.</li>
        </ul>
