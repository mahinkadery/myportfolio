        <h2>Tip Calculator – Split Bills Fairly & Calculate Gratuity Like a Pro</h2>
        
        <!-- 3. Introduction -->
        <p class="lead">
          Dining out with friends should be relaxing, but when the check arrives, it often becomes a stressful math problem. "What's 18% of $127.50?" "How do we split this four ways?" "Does the tip go on the pre-tax or post-tax amount?" These questions can turn a pleasant meal into an awkward debate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Tip Calculator</strong> by ToolfolioHub eliminates this friction entirely. It is a fast, accurate utility designed to calculate gratuity and split bills evenly among any number of people. Whether you are celebrating a birthday dinner for 10 or having a quiet date night for two, this tool ensures everyone pays their fair share without the mental math.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. What is -->
        <h2>What is a Tip Calculator?</h2>
        <p>
          A tip calculator (also called a "gratuity calculator" or "bill splitter") is a specialized financial utility that automates the process of calculating restaurant tips and dividing shared expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It handles three main calculations:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Tip Amount:</strong> Calculates the gratuity based on a percentage of the bill total.</li>
          <li><strong>Total Per Person:</strong> Divides the bill + tip evenly among all diners.</li>
          <li><strong>Tip Per Person:</strong> Shows how much each person is contributing to the tip.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          While this math is straightforward (Tip = Bill × Percentage, then Total = Bill + Tip, then Per Person = Total ÷ People), doing it mentally while sitting at a restaurant table is error-prone and stressful. Our calculator handles it instantly and accurately.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. Features -->
        <h2>Key Features & Benefits</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Fair & Accurate Bill Splitting</h3>
        <p>
          Splitting a bill isn't just about dividing the total. You need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculate the tip on the full amount.</li>
          <li>Add the tip to the bill.</li>
          <li>Divide that grand total evenly among everyone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our calculator does all three steps automatically. If four people share a $120 bill with a 20% tip, each person pays exactly $36.00—no guesswork, no rounding errors.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Customizable Tip Percentages</h3>
        <p>
          While most restaurants suggest 18%, 20%, or 22% on receipts, you might want to tip:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Less (15%):</strong> For below-average service.</li>
          <li><strong>More (25%+):</strong> For exceptional service or special occasions.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom amounts:</strong> Maybe 19.5% is your lucky number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our tool accepts any percentage you enter, giving you complete control over your gratuity.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Mobile-Optimized Design</h3>
        <p>
          This calculator is designed for use at the table. The interface is large, touch-friendly, and readable even in dim restaurant lighting. It loads instantly on mobile devices, so you don't have to wait for a heavy app to open.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Comprehensive Summary Display</h3>
        <p>
          We show you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tip Per Person:</strong> How much each person contributes to the tip.</li>
          <li><strong>Total Per Person:</strong> The final amount each person pays (bill + tip).</li>
          <li><strong>Summary Stats:</strong> Total tip amount and grand total for the whole bill.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This transparency prevents confusion and ensures everyone understands the breakdown.
        </p>

        <!-- 6. How to Use -->
        <h2>How to Use the Tip Calculator</h2>
        <p>
          The process is simple and takes seconds:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Enter the Bill Amount:</strong> Look at your receipt and type the total into the "Bill Total ($)" field. This is typically the subtotal before tax (though you can use the post-tax amount if you prefer—the difference is usually minimal).</li>
          <li><strong>Enter the Tip Percentage:</strong> Type the percentage you want to tip (without the % symbol). For example, for a 20% tip, just enter `20`.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter the Number of People:</strong> How many people are splitting the bill? Enter that number in the "People" field. If it's just you, leave it at 1.</li>
          <li><strong>Click "Calculate Split":</strong> The results appear instantly, showing exactly what each person owes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Example Walkthrough:</strong>
          <br>You had dinner with three friends. The bill is $95.00. You want to leave a 20% tip and split it four ways.
          <br>1. Enter `95` in Bill Total.
          <br>2. Enter `20` in Tip (%).
          <br>3. Enter `4` in People.
          <br>4. Click Calculate.
          <br>5. Result: Each person pays $28.50 ($4.75 tip + $23.75 bill portion each).
        </p>

        <!-- 7. Use Cases -->
        <h2>Typical Use-Cases & Audience</h2>

        <h3>Diners & Food Enthusiasts</h3>
        <p>
          Whether it is an intimate date night, a family celebration, or a large group gathering, calculating tips and splitting bills is a universal need. This tool makes the process effortless:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Date Nights:</strong> Quick calculation for two people ensures you leave the right amount without awkwardly pulling out your phone for long calculations.</li>
          <li><strong>Birthday Dinners:</strong> Large groups can split bills fairly. No one person gets stuck with a disproportionate share.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Meals:</strong> Calculate expenses accurately for reimbursement or expense reports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Travelers & Tourists</h3>
        <p>
          Tipping customs vary dramatically by country. In the United States, 15-20% is standard for restaurants. In many European countries, service charges are included, and additional tipping is optional. Our tool helps you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid under-tipping (which can be seen as rude).</li>
          <li>Avoid over-tipping (which wastes money).</li>
          <li>Calculate tips quickly in unfamiliar currencies or dining situations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Waitstaff & Service Industry Workers</h3>
        <p>
          If you work in the service industry, you can use this tool to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify that customers calculated tips correctly on credit card receipts.</li>
          <li>Calculate expected earnings based on sales volume.</li>
          <li>Split tips among multiple servers or bartenders fairly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Group Event Organizers</h3>
        <p>
          This tool is useful beyond restaurants:
        </p>

        <h2>Why Choose This Tool over Others?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No App Required:</strong> Many tip calculators require downloading an app that takes up storage space and requires updates. Ours works instantly in any web browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> We don't track your bills or location. Your dining habits remain private.</li>
          <li><strong>Works Offline:</strong> Once the page loads, you can use it without an internet connection (as long as you don't refresh). Perfect for restaurants with spotty Wi-Fi.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear, Large Display:</strong> The results are displayed in large, easy-to-read numbers. No squinting in dim lighting.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 9. FAQs -->
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        
        <h3>How much should I tip at a restaurant?</h3>
        <p>
          Tipping customs vary by location, but in the United States, standard guidelines are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>15-18%:</strong> Good, satisfactory service.</li>
          <li><strong>20%:</strong> Great service. This is considered the modern standard for good service.</li>
          <li><strong>22-25%:</strong> Exceptional service, special occasions, or fine dining.</li>
          <li><strong>Less than 15%:</strong> Only if service was noticeably poor. Consider speaking to a manager instead.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Some restaurants automatically add gratuity (usually 18-20%) for parties of 6 or more. Check your receipt before adding an additional tip.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I tip on the pre-tax or post-tax amount?</h3>
        <p>
          This is a common debate. The traditional rule is to tip on the <strong>pre-tax subtotal</strong>, as tax is not a service you received—it goes to the government. However, many people tip on the post-tax amount for simplicity, and this is also widely accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our calculator works with whichever amount you enter. If your bill shows a subtotal of $100 and tax of $8 (total $108), you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tip on $100 (traditional): Enter `100` as the bill amount.</li>
          <li>Tip on $108 (simple): Enter `108` as the bill amount.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The difference is minimal (20% of $100 = $20 vs. 20% of $108 = $21.60), so choose whichever method you prefer.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I split a bill when people ordered different amounts?</h3>
        <p>
          Our calculator assumes an even split (everyone pays the same amount). If people ordered different items:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Option 1 (Fair but Complex):</strong> Each person calculates their own portion + tip separately.</li>
          <li><strong>Option 2 (Simple but Rough):</strong> Use our calculator to see the "per person" amount as a baseline, then let people adjust based on what they ordered.</li>
          <li><strong>Option 3 (Common Practice):</strong> Split evenly anyway. The convenience often outweighs the small cost difference.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Can I use this for delivery or takeout orders?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! For delivery services (DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc.), tipping is usually done through the app. However, if you're picking up food yourself and want to tip the staff:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>10-15% is common for takeout/counter service.</li>
          <li>Enter your order total and desired tip percentage in our calculator.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Does the calculator round the results?</h3>
        <p>
          We show results to two decimal places (the standard for currency). You can choose to round up when writing the tip on the receipt (e.g., if the calculator shows $18.47, you might write $19.00 to make it a round number).
        </p>

        <!-- 10. Tips -->
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bookmark for Quick Access:</strong> Save this page to your phone's home screen or bookmarks for instant access when dining out.</li>
          <li><strong>Double-Check Receipts:</strong> Some restaurants automatically add gratuity for large parties. Always review your receipt before adding an extra tip to avoid double-tipping.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider Service Quality:</strong> While 20% is standard, adjust based on service. Exceptional service deserves more; poor service might warrant less (though consider speaking to management first).</li>
          <li><strong>Cash vs. Card:</strong> If you tip in cash, the server often receives it immediately. Tips on credit cards may be processed later. Both methods are acceptable.</li>
        </ul>
