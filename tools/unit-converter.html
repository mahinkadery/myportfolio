        <h2>Unit Converter – Master Metric & Imperial Conversions Instantly</h2>
        
        <!-- 3. Introduction -->
        <p class="lead">
          The world operates on different measurement systems. If you've ever tried to follow a European recipe that calls for 250 grams of flour when your kitchen scale only shows ounces, or wondered if you need a sweater when the weather app says 15°C, you know the frustration. Unit conversions shouldn't require a calculator, a conversion chart, and mental math.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Unit Converter</strong> by ToolfolioHub eliminates this hassle entirely. It is a fast, accurate, all-in-one conversion tool that handles length, weight, and temperature conversions instantly. No formulas to remember, no multiplication errors—just select your units and get the answer.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. What is -->
        <h2>What is a Unit Converter?</h2>
        <p>
          A unit converter is a tool that translates a quantity from one unit of measurement to another within the same category. For example, it can convert 5 kilometers to meters (5,000 m) or 25°C to Fahrenheit (77°F).
        </p>
        <p>
          The world primarily uses two measurement systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Metric System (SI):</strong> Used by most countries worldwide. Based on powers of 10 (kilometers, meters, centimeters; kilograms, grams).</li>
          <li><strong>Imperial System:</strong> Used primarily in the United States and a few other countries. Based on historical units (miles, feet, inches; pounds, ounces).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our converter focuses on the most common metric conversions (km, m, cm for length; kg, g for weight) and the universal temperature conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit), as these are the conversions people need most frequently.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. Features -->
        <h2>Key Features & Benefits</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Multi-Category Support</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of needing separate tools for length, weight, and temperature, our converter handles all three in one interface. Switch between categories seamlessly without leaving the page.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Bidirectional Conversion</h3>
        <p>
          Convert in either direction instantly. Need to convert kilometers to meters? Easy. Need to go the other way? Just swap the "From" and "To" units. The tool works both ways without any special settings.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Accurate Scientific Formulas</h3>
        <p>
          We use standard, internationally recognized conversion factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Length:</strong> 1 km = 1,000 m; 1 m = 100 cm</li>
          <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 1 kg = 1,000 g</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32; °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Results are calculated precisely and displayed with appropriate decimal precision for readability.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Instant Results</h3>
        <p>
          No page reloads, no waiting. Enter your value and click convert—the result appears immediately. This speed is especially valuable when you need quick conversions while cooking, traveling, or working on a project.
        </p>

        <!-- 6. How to Use -->
        <h2>How to Use the Unit Converter</h2>
        <p>
          The conversion process is straightforward:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Select a Category:</strong> Choose "Length," "Weight," or "Temperature" from the Category dropdown. This determines which unit options appear in the "From" and "To" dropdowns.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter Your Value:</strong> Type the number you want to convert into the "Value" field. You can enter whole numbers or decimals (e.g., `5`, `3.5`, `100.25`).</li>
          <li><strong>Choose Your Units:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Select the unit you're starting from in the "From" dropdown.</li>
              <li>Select the unit you want to convert to in the "To" dropdown.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Click "Convert":</strong> The converted value appears instantly in the Result field. You can also press `Enter` in the value field for faster conversion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Example Walkthrough:</strong>
          <br>You want to convert 2.5 kilometers to meters.
          <br>1. Select "Length" from Category.
          <br>2. Enter `2.5` in Value.
          <br>3. Select "Kilometers (km)" in From dropdown.
          <br>4. Select "Meters (m)" in To dropdown.
          <br>5. Click Convert.
          <br>6. Result: 2,500 m
        </p>

        <!-- 7. Use Cases -->
        <h2>Typical Use-Cases & Audience</h2>

        <h3>Home Cooks & Professional Bakers</h3>
        <p>
          Precision matters in baking. A European recipe calling for 200g of butter requires exact measurement. If your scale is broken and you only have volume measurements, converting to grams helps you find equivalent amounts. Even when using a scale, understanding metric weights helps you follow international recipes confidently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Common conversions:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recipe calls for 500g flour → need to measure by weight accurately.</li>
          <li>Package says 1 kg chicken → equals 1,000g for portion planning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Travelers & Expats</h3>
        <p>
          When traveling internationally, unit differences are everywhere:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Weather forecast shows 20°C—is that warm or cold? (Answer: pleasant, about 68°F).</li>
          <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Hotel is 3 km from the airport—how far is that in miles? (Answer: about 1.86 miles, though our tool focuses on metric length conversions).</li>
          <li><strong>Shopping:</strong> Buying produce at a market where everything is in kilograms—quick conversions help you estimate costs in familiar units.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Students & Educators</h3>
        <p>
          Science and math classes constantly require unit conversions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Problems often mix units. Converting 5 km to meters before calculating velocity ensures consistent units.</li>
          <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Lab measurements need precise conversions (grams to kilograms when calculating molar mass).</li>
          <li><strong>Geography:</strong> Understanding scale on maps requires converting between kilometers and meters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our tool helps students verify their manual calculations and catch errors before submitting assignments.
        </p>

        <h3>DIY Enthusiasts & Construction Workers</h3>

        <!-- 9. FAQs -->
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        
        <h3>Why don't you include imperial units like miles, feet, inches, or pounds?</h3>
        <p>
          Our current converter focuses on the most common metric conversions that people use daily. We prioritize:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Metric-to-metric conversions (km, m, cm; kg, g) which are universal.</li>
          <li>Temperature conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit) which everyone needs when traveling or checking weather.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may add imperial units (miles, feet, inches, pounds, ounces) in future updates. For now, focusing on metric ensures accuracy and simplicity.
        </p>

        <h3>Is 0°C the same as 0°F?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>No!</strong> These are completely different temperatures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0°C:</strong> The freezing point of water (32°F). This is a comfortable reference point.</li>
          <li><strong>0°F:</strong> Much colder, approximately -17.78°C. This would feel extremely cold in most climates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales have different zero points and different interval sizes, which is why simple multiplication doesn't work. You need the proper conversion formula, which our tool handles automatically.
        </p>

        <h3>How accurate are the conversions?</h3>
        <p>
          We use internationally standardized conversion factors, ensuring scientific accuracy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Length:</strong> Based on the official meter definition (1 km = 1,000 m exactly).</li>
          <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Based on the official kilogram definition (1 kg = 1,000 g exactly).</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Based on the standard Celsius-Fahrenheit conversion formula used by scientists worldwide.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Results are displayed with up to 4 decimal places for precision, then automatically cleaned (trailing zeros removed) for readability. This is more than accurate enough for any practical use case.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I convert negative temperatures?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Yes!</strong> Our converter handles negative temperatures correctly. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>-10°C = 14°F</li>
          <li>-40°C = -40°F (the point where both scales meet)</li>
          <li>0°F = -17.78°C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Negative temperatures are common in winter weather forecasts, scientific calculations, and freezer temperature settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Why does the converter round the results?</h3>
        <p>
          For practical use, displaying 15 decimal places (like `2.500000000000000`) is unnecessary and hard to read. Our converter:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculates with full precision internally.</li>
          <li>Displays results with up to 4 decimal places.</li>
          <li>Automatically removes trailing zeros for cleaner display (e.g., `2500` instead of `2500.0000`).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you need more precision for scientific purposes, the underlying calculation is accurate—you could manually extract more digits if needed (though 4 decimal places is usually more than sufficient).
        </p>

        <!-- 10. Tips -->
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Double-Check Critical Conversions:</strong> For important measurements (like medication dosages or construction projects), verify the conversion matches your expectations. Use common reference points (e.g., 100°C = 212°F, 1 km = 1,000 m) to spot-check accuracy.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Consistent Units in Calculations:</strong> When solving math problems, convert all values to the same unit system before calculating. Our tool helps you standardize units quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Bookmark for Quick Access:</strong> Save this page to your browser bookmarks or home screen for instant access when you need conversions on the go.</li>
